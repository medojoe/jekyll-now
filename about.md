*Medhat Youssef*, known on social networks as Medo joe, is just a guy who fell in love with code. Like millions in the worlds who never knew they would be involved in technology, he realized that his purpose in life was to produce code to benefit the user. He found his euphoria in successful code. He lives off better web design and smarter web development. He can never have enough of programming frameworks. For example, the word "Laravel" gives him the goosebumps. The word "PHP" along with "JS" make his eyes glow in impulsive attention.

## Goal

This tutorial zone has one and only one goal, proving that coding and web development is not a scary monster. At least, not anymore. We strive to prove that anyone can learn to code easily. Ofcourse it's proven that anyone could learn to code. But learning to code in an easy manner has been a theory I wanted to address for a long time. It is time to face that fact and put that monster to sleep forever. No more complex tutorials, no more intensive and big words. The internet user who starts out to learn programming is chased away by big terms and bumped up concepts. It's time to approach programming computers in a slang everybody can understand. Are you ready? Let's Go!
